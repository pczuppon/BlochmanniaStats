# BlochmanniaStats
Statistical analysis (generalized linear model) of data from the manuscript "Harbouring Blochmannia incurs costs: a trade-off between the necessity of the obligate primary endosymbiont for brood development and its costs for adult carpenter ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)" published in Myrmecological News 33:211-219, doi:10.25849/myrmecol.news_033:211.

## Data
The data consists of survival numbers from egg to larval stage and successful development numbers from larval to pupal stage. More details on the experimental design are available in the publication.

## Statistical model
We conducted a logistic regression for each subset of data. More details can be found in the commented R script and the publication.
